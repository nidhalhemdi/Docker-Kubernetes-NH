# **Inspecting Images**

### **What an Image Actually Contains**

* A Docker image includes:

  * Your **app code**
  * The **application environment** (e.g., Node, Python)
  * A base **OS layer** (e.g., Linux)
* Containers do **not** store a copy of the image — they run on top of the image using:

  * A **thin, writable container layer**
  * Image layers remain **read-only and shared** between containers.

# 🔍 **`docker image inspect`**

Use this command to inspect an image in detail:

```bash
docker image inspect <IMAGE_ID>
```

### **What you learn from the output:**

#### ✔ **Basic Info**

* **Full image ID**
* **Creation timestamp**
* **Docker version**

#### ✔ **Configuration Details (important)**

* **Exposed ports**
* **Environment variables**
* **Entry point + Command** (what runs when a container starts)

#### ✔ **System Info**

* **Operating system** used (from the base image)

#### ✔ **Layers**

* Shows **all layers** that make up the image:

  * Layers from **your Dockerfile commands**
  * Layers inherited from the **base image**
* This explains image caching and why images rebuild if a base dependency changes.

# 🧩 **Why Inspecting Helps**

You may inspect an image to:

* Check **how it was built**
* See **exposed ports, env vars, entrypoint**
* Understand **layer structure** for performance or debugging
* Inspect external images you pulled (e.g., from Docker Hub)

Example:

```bash
docker image inspect node
```

Shows configuration and layers of the official Node image.
