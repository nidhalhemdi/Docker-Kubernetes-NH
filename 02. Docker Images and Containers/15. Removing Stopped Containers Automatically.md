# **Removing Stopped Containers Automatically**

### **Key Idea**

Docker containers that stop remain on your system unless you manually remove them. Over time, this creates a long list of stopped containers.
To avoid this, Docker provides the `--rm` flag when running containers.

---

# 🔑 **Important Command: `--rm`**

### **`--rm`**

Automatically removes the container as soon as it *exits/stops*.

You add it to `docker run`:

```bash
docker run --rm ...
```

This means:

* You **do not** need to manually run `docker rm` later.
* The container **won’t appear** in `docker ps -a` after it stops.

---

# 🧰 **Example Command**

Run a container:

* publish port 3000
* in detached mode
* auto-remove when stopped

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --rm <image-id>
```

After stopping the container:

```bash
docker stop <container-name>
```

If you check all containers:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

➡️ **It will NOT appear anymore** (because `--rm` removed it automatically).

---

# 📌 **When to Use `--rm`**

Use this flag when:

* You rarely need to restart a container.
* You rebuild images frequently (e.g., Node.js apps during development).
* You're running temporary containers or demos.

It is **very common** to use `--rm` for development containers.
