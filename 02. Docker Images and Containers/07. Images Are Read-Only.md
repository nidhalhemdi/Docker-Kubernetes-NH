# **Images Are Read-Only**

Here, we explain one of the most important concepts in Docker.

## **1. Why code changes don't show up**

You edited your local source code and re-ran the container, but nothing changed.
Why?

Because the Dockerfile has:

```
COPY . .
```

This copies the **current** state of your project **into the image** when you build it.

After the image is built:

* The image **does not track** your local files.
* The image does **not update** when you change your code.
* A container is always created **from the exact snapshot** inside the image.

## **2. Images are immutable**

Once built:

* An image is finished, fixed, unchangeable.
* Anything inside is **read-only**.
* Updating your project files *outside* the image does nothing.

## **3. To pick up changes: Rebuild the image**

You must run:

```
docker build .
```

This creates a **new** image with updated code.
You then run a container from the *new* image.

After rebuilding:

* You get a **different** image ID.
* Running `docker run <new-id>` will show the updated change (e.g., the exclamation mark).

## **4. Containers Don’t Update Themselves**

Stopping and restarting the same container does **not** refresh its code.
Containers are created from images—if the image doesn’t change, neither does the container.


The essential rule is:

> **Images do NOT automatically reflect local code changes. Rebuild to update.**
