# **Understanding Attached & Detached Containers**

---

## ✅ **Core Concepts**

### **1. Attached vs Detached Mode**

Docker containers can run in **two modes**:

#### **Attached Mode (default for `docker run`)**

* Your terminal is *attached* to the container’s main process.
* You **see the container’s output/logs** directly in the terminal.
* The terminal becomes “blocked”—you can’t type new commands.

#### **Detached Mode (default for `docker start`, optional for `docker run`)**

* The container runs *in the background*.
* The terminal is **not blocked**.
* You **don’t see the logs** unless you manually view them.

---

# ✅ **Commands & Practical Tips**

### **Start a container (attached, default for `docker run`)**

```bash
docker run -p 8000:80 <image>
```

* You are attached to logs.
* Terminal is blocked until the container stops.

### **Start a container (detached mode)**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:80 <image>
```

* Container runs in the background.
* Terminal stays free.
* No logs visible unless you fetch them.

### **Start an existing stopped container**

Default → **detached**:

```bash
docker start <container>
```

Start in **attached mode**:

```bash
docker start -a <container>
```

# ✅ **Viewing Logs of Detached Containers**

### **See past logs**

```bash
docker logs <container>
```

### **Follow logs (live)**

Similar to attaching, but only shows logs:

```bash
docker logs -f <container>
```

# ✅ **Attaching to a Running Container**

If a container is running in detached mode, you can re-attach:

```bash
docker attach <container>
```

This shows **future output**, not past logs.

---

# ✅ **Stopping Containers**

```bash
docker stop <container>
```

Gracefully stops a running container.

# ⭐ **Key Takeaways**

* **Attached mode** → terminal shows all container output; blocks the terminal.
* **Detached mode** → container runs in background; terminal free.
* Use **`-d`** with `docker run` to detach.
* Use **`docker logs`** for log output in detached containers.
* Use **`docker attach`** or **`docker logs -f`** to follow runtime output.
* Use **`docker start -a`** to restart a stopped container *attached*.
