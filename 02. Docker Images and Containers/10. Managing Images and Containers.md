# **Managing Images and Containers**

- shifting focus from creating images and running containers to **how to manage and configure them**. Here's the distilled essence:

---

## **1. Every Docker Command Has Help Available**

For any Docker command, you can append:

```
--help
```

This shows all available options and flags.
Most options you won’t use often, but this is essential for discovering what's possible.

## **2. What You’ll Learn in This Part**

The upcoming lectures will cover how to manage both **images** and **containers** more effectively. Specifically:

### **Image Management**

* **Tagging images** → assigning readable names instead of random IDs.
* **Listing images** you’ve built.
* **Inspecting/analyzing images** to understand what's inside.
* **Removing images** you no longer need to free disk space.

### **Container Management**

* **Naming containers** so you don’t rely on auto-generated names.
* **Configuring containers** with various runtime options.
* **Listing containers** (running and stopped).
* **Restarting containers** that were stopped earlier.
* **Removing containers** once they’re no longer needed.

## **3. Why This Matters**

Up to now, you’ve learned the basics:

* building images
* running containers
* stopping containers

But real-world Docker usage requires deeper control. These tools let you keep your system clean, organized, and efficient.
