# **Deleting Images & Containers**

## **1. Why delete containers/images?**

* Over time your system fills with **stopped containers** and **unused images**.
* Cleaning them keeps Docker organized and saves disk space.

# 🗑 **Deleting Containers**

### **List containers**

* Running containers:
  `docker ps`
* All containers (including stopped):
  `docker ps -a`

### **You CANNOT remove a running container.**

* If you try:
  `docker rm <container>` → ❌ error
* You must **stop it first**.

### **Stop containers**

* `docker stop <container-name-or-id>`

### **Remove containers**

* `docker rm <container>`
* You can delete multiple at once:
  `docker rm <id1> <id2> <id3>`

---

# 🗑 **Deleting Images**

### **List images**

* `docker images`

### **Remove an image**

* `docker rmi <image-id>`

### **Important rule:**

➡️ You **cannot** delete an image if **any container (running or stopped)** still uses it.
You must delete those containers first.

---

# 🧹 **Remove ALL unused images**

* `docker image prune`
* Removes images **not used by any running container**.

⚠️ `image prune` can delete a lot — use carefully.

---

# 🎯 Result after cleanup

* Your `docker ps -a` becomes empty.
* Your `docker images` only contains images you actually use (ex: the base Node image + your latest build).
