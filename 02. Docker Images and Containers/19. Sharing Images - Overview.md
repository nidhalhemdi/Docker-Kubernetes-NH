# **Sharing Images – Overview**

### **Why share Docker images?**

Docker helps avoid reinstalling dependencies locally and allows multiple projects with different versions (e.g., Python 3.7 + Python 3.9) to coexist without conflicts.

But another major use of Docker is **sharing** your apps with:

* Other developers
* Other machines you own
* Deployment servers

**You never share containers — you share images.**
Anyone with an image can run containers from it.

# 🔄 **Two Ways to Share Images**

## **1. Share the Dockerfile + source code**

* You give someone the project *and* its Dockerfile.
* They build the image locally with `docker build`.
* This requires:

  * Dockerfile
  * All necessary source files in the same structure

---

## **2. Share a finished, built image (most common)**

* Like the official `node` image from Docker Hub.
* You don’t get its Dockerfile locally.
* Instead you “pull” the final built image.

Example:

```bash
docker run node
```

This automatically downloads the official “node” image from Docker Hub.

Sharing the *finished image* means:

* No build step required.
* No source code required.
* You can run containers immediately.

This is how teams usually share images and how deployment works.

# ⭐ Key Takeaways

* **You share *images*, not containers.**
* Two sharing methods:

  1. **Share Dockerfile + code** (recipient builds image)
  2. **Share finished image** (recipient pulls and runs immediately)
* Most professional workflows use method **#2**, especially for deployment.
* Official images (like `node`) are shared the same way — you pull them as complete images.
