# **Pushing Images to DockerHub**

### **Why push images?**

* To share built Docker images with others (team members, servers, or yourself on another machine).
* You don’t send image files manually — Docker uses registries.
* Main registry choices:

  * **Docker Hub (official & free tier available)**
  * Private registries (AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)

---

# **How to Push an Image to Docker Hub**

### **1. Create a Docker Hub account**

* Go to hub.docker.com → sign up → free plan is enough.

---

# **2. Create a Repository on Docker Hub**

* Go to **Repositories → Create Repository**.
* Choose a **name** (example: `node-hello-world`).
* Choose **public** or **private** (free plan has only 1 private repo).

---

# **3. Your local image must match the repository name**

Docker Hub expects this format:

```
<dockerhub-username>/<repository-name>:<tag>
```

Example:

```
nidhalhaamdii/node-hello-world:latest
```

### If your image is called something else (e.g. `node-demo:latest`), retag it:

```
docker tag node-demo:latest nidhalhaamdii/node-hello-world:latest
```

> Retagging **clones** the image under a new name; it does NOT delete the original.

---

# **4. Log in to Docker Hub from the CLI**

```
docker login
```

* Enter Docker ID + password.
* You stay logged in until you explicitly `docker logout`.

---

# **5. Push the image**

```
docker push nidhalhaamdii/node-hello-world:latest
```

Docker optimizes the upload:

* It **does NOT re-upload base layers** (like the Node image)
* Only uploads **your app’s layers**.

---

# **6. Check it on Docker Hub**

* After push completes, refresh your repo page.
* You’ll see the image and its tags (e.g. `latest`).

---

# **Important Notes**

* If pushing to a private registry (not Docker Hub), you must include the registry host in the image name:

  ```
  <registry-host>/<user>/<repo>:tag
  ```
* For Docker Hub, **no host** is needed — default is hub.docker.com.
