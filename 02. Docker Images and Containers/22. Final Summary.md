# **Summary**

### **Core Idea**

Docker’s foundation is **Images** and **Containers**.
Images = *templates / blueprints*.
Containers = *running instances based on those images*.

---

## **🧱 Images**

* Built using a **Dockerfile** → `docker build`.
* Or downloaded from registries → `docker pull`.
* Typically start from a **base image** (e.g., `node`, `python`, `alpine`).
* Dockerfile instructions (COPY, RUN, WORKDIR, CMD, etc.) create **layers**.
* Layers:

  * Allow **caching** → faster rebuilds.
  * Allow **reusability** → shared base layers across systems.
* Shared images can be pushed/pulled on Docker Hub → `docker push`.

---

## **📦 Containers**

* Containers run based on images → `docker run IMAGE`.
* Run in **isolation**, using the **environment stored in the image**.
* Application code lives in the image; container only executes it.
* Multiple containers can run **from the same image**, independently.

### **Useful docker run options**

* `-it` → interactive terminal
* `--name` → assign container name
* `--rm` → auto-remove when stopped
* Many additional flags (networking, volumes, ports, etc.) will be seen later.

## **🔧 Managing Docker Resources**

### Containers:

* List → `docker ps` / `docker ps -a`
* Stop / Start → `docker stop` / `docker start`
* Remove → `docker rm`

### Images:

* List → `docker images`
* Remove → `docker rmi`
* Share → `docker push`, `docker pull`

## **📌 Final Notes**

* If concepts are unclear, revisit earlier lectures.
* A **cheat sheet** is attached right after this lecture—use it for quick reference.
* The assignment in this module is recommended for practice.
