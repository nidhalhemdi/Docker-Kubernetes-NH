# **Kubernetes Networking**

## **Module Introduction**

### **What This Module Covers**

This section focuses on **how containers and pods communicate** in Kubernetes and how they are exposed to the outside world.
It mirrors what you learned in Docker / Docker Compose networking, but at the Kubernetes level.

### **Key Topics Introduced**

1. **Services (review)**

   * You already used Kubernetes Services earlier, but this module revisits them briefly to understand their role in networking.

2. **Pod-Internal Communication**

   * A pod can contain **multiple containers**.
   * This module will teach how these containers **communicate inside the same pod**.

3. **Pod-to-Pod Communication**

   * How different pods communicate across the cluster — something not covered earlier.
   * Essential for multi-service applications (e.g., backend talks to database, frontend talks to backend).

4. **Exposing Pods to the Outside World**

   * Ensuring some containers are reachable externally through Services.

# **Definitions**

### **Pod**

A small unit in Kubernetes that contains one or more containers running together.

### **Service**

A stable network endpoint inside Kubernetes that lets other pods — or the outside world — reliably reach your containers.
(Useful because pod IPs change.)

### **Pod-Internal Communication**

Communication between **containers inside the same pod**.
They share:

* Same network namespace
* Same IP
  → They can talk to each other via **localhost**.

### **Pod-to-Pod Communication**

Communication between **containers running in different pods**, across the cluster network.

# **What to Expect in This Module**

You will learn:

* How containers talk to each other *inside* a pod
* How different pods talk to each other
* How Services act as the communication layer
* How Kubernetes networking differs from Docker networking
