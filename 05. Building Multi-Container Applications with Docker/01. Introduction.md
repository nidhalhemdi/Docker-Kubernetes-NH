# **Module Introduction**

## **What This Module Is About**

* This module continues the multi-container work started in the **Networking** section.
* Goal: **Build a realistic application made of multiple services**, each running in its own container.
* Common real-life setup = multiple services working together:

  * **Database**
  * **Backend API**
  * **Frontend UI**

## **Why Multi-Container Apps Matter**

* Real-world apps rarely run in a single container.
* You often combine:

  * Different runtimes (Node, Python, Go…)
  * Different responsibilities (DB, API, UI)
* Docker makes this possible by:

  * Packaging each service into its own container
  * Letting them communicate via **Docker networking**

## **What You'll Practice**

This module does **not introduce new concepts**.
Instead, you **apply** what you learned earlier:

* Building images
* Running containers
* Using volumes
* Using networks
* Managing internal/external ports
* Connecting multiple containers together

## **Module Objectives**

✔ Combine several services → **one working application**
✔ Use Docker to run them → **multiple containers**
✔ See how containers talk to each other
✔ Practice with a realistic scenario
