You learn how to **dockerize your React app** so that:

### 1. **Your React code automatically reloads when you change files**

Live-reloading works with React’s development server, and Docker bind mounts let your updates reach the container.

### 2. **You avoid copying unnecessary files (like `node_modules`) into the image**

By using a `.dockerignore` file.

# 🧩 **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

## **1. Stopping the old frontend container**

The React dev server container was originally started with `-it`,
so **Ctrl + C** stops it *and removes it* (because it ran in the foreground, not detached mode).

Now only MongoDB + Node backend are still running.

---

## **2. Re-starting the React container with a Bind Mount**

You want live updates, so Docker needs to see file changes.

### ✔ Use a bind mount:

You bind **your project `/src` folder** to the container’s working directory `/app/src`.

Command (structure):

```
docker run -v <local-path-to-src>:/app/src IMAGE_NAME
```

Why `/src` only?

* `/src` is where React code lives and changes frequently.
* No need to mount the whole project folder.
* Mounting only `/src` is cleaner and faster.

Now React’s development server sees your file changes and recompiles automatically.

---

## **3. Why React doesn’t need `nodemon`**

For Node backend you needed nodemon.

But for React:

* The **React development server** already watches for file changes
* And automatically recompiles
* So **no extra tools** needed

Docker bind mount → changes appear inside the container → React automatically reloads.

---

## **4. Fixing the `.dockerignore` Problem**

Building the image was slow because:

* You copied your entire project folder into the image
* Including your **local `node_modules`**
* That is big and unnecessary
* It can overwrite container-installed dependencies (bad)

### Add `.dockerignore`:

```
node_modules
.git
Dockerfile
```

This prevents copying extra files → MUCH faster builds.

You rebuilt and confirmed the image builds instantly.

# 🧠 **Extra Note for Windows Users (important)**

On Windows + WSL2, file watching **might not work** if the project is in the **Windows filesystem** (e.g. `/mnt/c/...`).

Fix:
👉 Keep your project inside the **Linux filesystem** (`~/projects/...`).

Then Docker file-watching works correctly.

---

# 🎯 **What You Achieved**

By the end of this lecture:

### ✔ React development server runs inside Docker

### ✔ Live reload works when you edit code

### ✔ Only real source code is bind-mounted

### ✔ Image builds faster thanks to `.dockerignore`

### ✔ No dependency issues

You now have all **three containers** working with live updates:

* MongoDB (via published port)
* Node backend (with bind mount + nodemon + volumes)
* React frontend (with bind mount + development server)
