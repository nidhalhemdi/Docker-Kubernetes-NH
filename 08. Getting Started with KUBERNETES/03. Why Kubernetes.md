# **Why Kubernetes?**

## **1. ECS already solves many deployment problems**

AWS ECS gives you:

* **Health checks** → automatically detects if containers are alive
* **Auto-restart** → restarts failing containers (we saw this when DB connection failed)
* **Auto-scaling** → increases/decreases container count based on traffic
* **Load balancing** → distributes traffic evenly across container instances

So ECS **already automates**:

* container recovery
* scaling
* traffic distribution

➡️ This is great, and it's why ECS is a powerful managed service.

# **2. The big downside of ECS (and similar cloud services)**

Using ECS creates **vendor lock-in**.

### **What vendor lock-in means**

If you use ECS:

* You must use **AWS-specific concepts**
  (Clusters, Tasks, Task Definitions, Services)
* You must configure things **the AWS way**
* You must use AWS-specific:

  * settings
  * CLI commands
  * config files

If you want to switch cloud providers (Azure, Google Cloud, etc.):

* **Your config files do NOT work there**
* You must **learn a whole new system**
* You must **rebuild all configs from scratch**
* You lose portability
  → You are tied to AWS.

---

# **3. Why this is a problem**

If your company wants to:

* Move to Azure
* Deploy across multiple cloud providers
* Avoid dependence on AWS
* Use on-premise servers + cloud together

…then ECS config and knowledge **cannot be reused**.

You would have to learn:

* Azure Container Apps / AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
* Google Cloud Run / GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
* Their rules, naming, UI, config files, limits

➡️ **Each cloud provider has its own language.**

# **4. Kubernetes solves the vendor lock-in problem**

Kubernetes is **cloud-agnostic**.

You can run Kubernetes:

* On AWS
* On Azure
* On Google Cloud
* On-premise servers
* On your laptop
* On hybrid setups

**Same YAML files. Same commands. Same concepts.**

This means:

* You learn Kubernetes once → works everywhere.
* Your deployment config becomes portable.
* Switching cloud providers becomes much easier.
* You avoid being trapped in one ecosystem.

This is one of the **biggest reasons companies adopt Kubernetes**.

# **5. Key Takeaways**

✔ ECS automates restarts, scaling, and load balancing.
✔ But ECS is AWS-specific → creates vendor lock-in.
✔ Cloud switching becomes painful.
✔ Kubernetes is universal and portable → works on every cloud and even locally.
✔ With Kubernetes, you learn one system that applies everywhere.

# **6. Super concise mental model**

ECS is like:

> “AWS’s custom way of running containers.”

Kubernetes is like:

> “A universal standard for running containers anywhere.”
