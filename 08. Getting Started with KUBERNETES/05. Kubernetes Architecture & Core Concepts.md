# **Kubernetes: Architecture & Core Concepts**

## **1. Kubernetes = a system made of many components**

Kubernetes is not a single tool.
It is a **collection of concepts + tools** that together allow you to:

* Deploy containers anywhere
* Scale them
* Restart them on failure
* Distribute them across machines
* Expose them to the outside world

To understand this, we break Kubernetes into **pods**, **nodes**, and the **control plane**.

---

# **2. Pods (smallest unit in Kubernetes)**

### **What is a Pod?**

A **pod** is the **smallest unit** Kubernetes manages.
A pod **holds container(s)** — usually **one container**, but can contain multiple if they must run together.

### Key points:

* Pods run your containers
* They can contain more than one container (rare; for tightly coupled containers)
* You define pods in YAML configs
* Kubernetes creates and manages them for you

---

# **3. Worker Nodes (where containers actually run)**

### **What is a worker node?**

A **worker node** is simply a **machine** (physical or virtual) where your pods and containers run.

Examples:

* An AWS EC2 instance
* A VM on any cloud
* A physical server

### Worker node responsibilities:

* Runs your pods
* Provides CPU, RAM, networking
* Can run multiple pods at the same time

### Kubernetes also installs a **network proxy** on each worker node:

* Controls pod network traffic
* Lets pods reach the internet
* Lets the outside world reach your app (web server, API, etc.)

---

# **4. Multiple Worker Nodes = Scaling**

In real deployments:

* You typically have **multiple worker nodes**
* Kubernetes distributes pods across nodes
* If traffic increases → Kubernetes can **add pods** and place them on available nodes
* If traffic decreases → Kubernetes removes pods

Kubernetes handles:

* Load distribution
* Resource balancing
* Ensuring enough compute power across nodes

---

# **5. Master Node (Control Plane) — the “brain” of Kubernetes**

### **What is the master node?**

A **separate machine** running the **control plane**, which manages everything.

You **usually never interact directly** with worker nodes.
Instead, you define your desired state (YAML), and the **control plane makes it happen**.

### **Responsibilities of the control plane:**

* Creates pods
* Replaces failed pods
* Shuts down unneeded pods
* Communicates with worker nodes
* Ensures the cluster matches your desired state

### Control plane components include:

* API Server
* Scheduler
* Controller Manager
* etc.
  (Explained in a later lecture.)

You can technically run everything on **one machine** (master + worker),
but in real-world deployments:

* You use one or multiple master nodes (for high availability)
* And multiple worker nodes

---

# **6. The Kubernetes Cluster**

A **cluster** =
**Master node(s)** + **Worker node(s)**
all connected in one network.

The control plane can also talk to your **cloud provider** to create resources like:

* EC2 instances (worker nodes)
* Load balancers
* Networking components

Example:
On AWS, Kubernetes can instruct AWS to create:

* EC2 worker nodes
* A load balancer
* Networking rules
* And deploy your entire system using your YAML definitions

---

# **7. Big Picture Mental Model**

* You write a YAML file describing how your app should run
* Kubernetes Master Node (Control Plane) reads it
* Control Plane creates & manages Pods on Worker Nodes
* Worker Nodes run your containers
* Kubernetes ensures everything always matches your desired end state
* If something fails → Kubernetes fixes it automatically
