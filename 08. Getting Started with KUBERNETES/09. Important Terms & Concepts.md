# 🌐 **Kubernetes – Key Terms You Must Know**

### **1. Cluster**

A **cluster** is the whole Kubernetes system:
➡️ A collection of **nodes** (machines) working together.
➡️ It includes both **master (control plane)** and **worker nodes**.

---

### **2. Nodes**

A **node** is a physical or virtual machine in the cluster.

There are **two types**:

#### **a. Master Node (Control Plane)**

Responsible for:

* Managing the cluster
* Deciding where pods go
* Ensuring everything is healthy

Runs components such as:

* API Server
* Scheduler
* Controller Manager

#### **b. Worker Nodes**

These are the machines that **actually run your application**.
Each worker node hosts:

* Pods
* Containers inside those pods
* Resources needed by those containers

---

### **3. Pods**

A **pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
It is basically a **wrapper** around one or more containers and their resources.

Think of it as:
🟦 A pod starts and manages the container (as if it were running `docker run` internally)

Pods are created and placed on worker nodes by the **master node**.

---

### **4. Containers**

These are still your **regular Docker containers**.
Kubernetes doesn’t replace Docker; it orchestrates it.

A pod "holds" the container and ensures it runs correctly.

---

### **5. Services**

You will see these in the next module, but here's the idea:

A **service** is a stable way to reach a group of pods.

➡️ Pods may die, restart, or move to other nodes
➡️ Their IPs change all the time
➡️ But a **service keeps a constant IP** (and optionally a domain)

Services make sure:

* Pods can be accessed reliably
* Load balancing can occur
* External traffic can reach your app (when needed)

---

## 🎯 **Why These Terms Matter**

You need these concepts to understand:

* How Kubernetes schedules and runs containers
* How your application is exposed internally and externally
* How Kubernetes keeps your app alive automatically
