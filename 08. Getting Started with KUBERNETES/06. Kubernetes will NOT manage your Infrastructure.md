# **Kubernetes will NOT manage your Infrastructure!**

## **1. Key Idea: Kubernetes uses infrastructure — it does NOT create it**

Kubernetes can:

* run containers
* restart failed containers
* scale pods
* distribute pods across nodes

BUT Kubernetes **cannot create the machines (nodes) it needs to run on**.

You must **prepare the environment first**.

---

# **2. What *you* must do before Kubernetes can work**

You (developer or admin) must provide the infrastructure:

### **You must create the cluster machines:**

* Master node(s) (control plane)
* Worker node(s)

### **You must install Kubernetes on them:**

* Kubernetes software
* Required tools (kubelet, kubeadm, etc.)
* Network configuration

### **You must provide additional cloud resources (depending on provider):**

Examples:

* Load balancers
* Filesystems / storage (EBS, EFS, etc.)
* Networking (VPC, subnets, security groups)

**Kubernetes will use these resources — it will not create them.**

---

# **3. After infrastructure is ready → Kubernetes takes over**

Once the cluster is created and Kubernetes is installed:

### Kubernetes will:

* Create pods
* Start the containers
* Distribute pods across nodes
* Restart pods when they fail
* Maintain the desired state of deployments
* Handle scaling (if configured)
* Monitor everything automatically

### Kubernetes will NOT:

* Provision servers
* Install itself on machines
* Create cloud infrastructure
* Set up your networks or load balancers

---

# **4. Analogy with Docker Compose**

Think of it like this:

### Docker Compose:

❌ Does not install Docker
❌ Does not set up your machine
✔️ Only **uses your machine** to run containers

### Kubernetes:

❌ Does not create worker/master nodes
❌ Does not install itself
❌ Does not create cloud resources
✔️ Only **uses your cluster** to run and manage pods

---

# **5. Tools will help you (so don’t worry)**

Even though you must prepare the infrastructure:

* Local development tools (like **Minikube**, **Kind**, **Docker Desktop Kubernetes**) make it simple.
* Cloud providers (like **AWS**) offer helper services to generate the needed resources.

### We will show you:

* How to set up a **local** Kubernetes environment
* How to create a **cluster on AWS**
* Then how to deploy apps on both

So while Kubernetes itself doesn't do infrastructure provisioning,
**tools around it make cluster creation easy.**

# **6. The Important Distinction**

✔ **Kubernetes manages containers (pods)**
✘ **Kubernetes does NOT manage infrastructure**

You must build the foundation;
Kubernetes runs the workload on top of it.
