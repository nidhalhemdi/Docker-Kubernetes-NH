# **A Closer Look at the Master Node**

The **Master Node** (also called the **Control Plane**) is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster.
It does **not** run application containers.
Instead, it **controls everything** that happens on the Worker Nodes.

Inside the Master Node, several key components/services are running:

---

## **1. API Server (The Heart of Kubernetes)**

This is the **most important component**.

* Acts as the central entry point for *all* communication
* The **kubelet** on each Worker Node talks to the API Server
* kubectl commands (or cloud controllers) also communicate with it
* Validates requests and updates the cluster state

Think of it as:
➡️ **The front desk / communication hub of Kubernetes**

---

## **2. Scheduler**

Responsible for deciding **where new pods should run**.

It checks:

* Which Worker Node has enough CPU/memory?
* Which nodes are healthy?
* Which nodes meet requirements (labels, taints, affinities)?

It then picks a Worker Node and tells the API Server:

➡️ "Create this pod on Worker Node X."

Use cases:

* A pod crashes → scheduler assigns a replacement node
* Scaling up replicas → scheduler picks nodes for new pods

## **3. Controller Manager**

A set of controllers that constantly watch the state of the cluster.

### What it does:

* Ensures the correct number of pods are running
* Ensures nodes are healthy
* Restarts or replaces failed pods
* Watches for changes and triggers actions

Think of it as:
➡️ **The cluster supervisor ensuring everything matches the “desired state”.**

### Cloud-Specific Version:

**Cloud Controller Manager**

* Integrates Kubernetes with cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Controls cloud resources like:

  * Load balancers
  * Networking
  * Storage volumes

It basically translates Kubernetes instructions into cloud-provider APIs.

Example:
Kubernetes says “Create a load balancer” → Cloud Controller Manager calls AWS ELB/ALB APIs.

## **4. How Cloud Providers Simplify This**

Cloud platforms (EKS, GKE, AKS):

* Install and manage all Master Node components for you
* Manage high availability & security
* Integrate Kubernetes with their cloud services

You only provide Kubernetes YAML — they do the heavy lifting.

# **Master Node Summary Table**

| Component                    | Role                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Server**               | Communication hub; receives all requests; talks to kubelets |
| **Scheduler**                | Decides on which Worker Node new pods run                   |
| **Controller Manager**       | Ensures desired state; manages pods/nodes                   |
| **Cloud Controller Manager** | Connects Kubernetes to AWS/Azure/GCP resources              |

# **Easy Analogy**

### **Master Node = Control Tower**

### **Worker Nodes = Airplanes**

### **Pods/Containers = Passengers**

The control tower does NOT fly planes — it:

* directs them
* monitors them
* tells them where to go
* ensures the right number are in the air

That’s exactly what the Master Node does for your Kubernetes cluster.
