# **What is `.dockerignore` and why do we need it?**

When you use:

```
COPY . /app
```

Docker copies **everything** from your project folder into the image — unless you tell it not to.

This is where the **`.dockerignore`** file comes in.

It works exactly like `.gitignore`, but for Docker.

# 🚫 **Why ignoring files matters**

Some folders **should NOT** be copied into the image, such as:

* `node_modules/`
* `.git/`
* `logs/`
* `temp files`

### **Why not copy your host’s `node_modules`?**

Because:

1. It might be **outdated**
2. It might be **incomplete**
3. It might have dependencies that work on your machine but **not inside the container**
4. It makes the image build **slower and bigger**
5. Inside the image, you already run:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   which creates the *correct* `node_modules` for that environment.

If Docker copies your local `node_modules` into the image, it could **overwrite the container’s own correct node_modules** — causing errors.

# 🛑 **Solution: use `.dockerignore`**

Example:

```
node_modules
.git
*.log
```

This file tells Docker:

> “When using COPY, skip these files/folders.”

# 💡 **Key idea from the lecture**

You *could* copy everything, but using `.dockerignore`:

* keeps your image **clean**
* prevents copying unnecessary or harmful files
* speeds up the build
* ensures the image gets **fresh node_modules created inside** (via `npm install`)

Even if (in your current example) the folder doesn’t exist yet, it's still a good practice — because one day it *will* exist if you run `npm install` locally.

---

# 🧠 **In short:**

`.dockerignore` = “Don’t copy these things into the image”

The most important entry for Node.js projects is:

```
node_modules/
```

so Docker uses the *container's own* dependencies instead of yours.
