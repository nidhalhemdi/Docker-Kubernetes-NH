## 🎯 **What Is the Problem that we are Explaining?**

Docker containers **can store data**, but **that data lives *inside* the container’s own temporary filesystem**.

That leads to an important consequence:

### ✅ If you *stop* a container → the data stays

### ❌ If you *remove* (delete) a container → the data is lost forever

Why?
Because a container’s filesystem is **ephemeral** — it exists only as long as the container exists.

---

## 🧠 **Why Does This Happen?**

Let’s break it down:

### 🟦 **Images**

* Read-only
* Serve as the base filesystem
* Never change when a container writes files

### 🟩 **Containers**

* Add a thin *read-write* layer on top of the image
* All new files (like the feedback text file) go into this layer

### 🚨 When you delete a container:

You delete its *read-write layer*, so all written data disappears.

---

## 📌 Example From the Lecture:

1. You run the container **with `--rm`**
   → This causes the container to be automatically deleted when stopped
   → So the feedback file disappears permanently

2. You run the container **without `--rm`**
   → Stopping does NOT delete the container
   → Restarting keeps your file

3. But when you rebuild the image or start a *new* container
   → New container = new file system
   → Old data = gone

---

## 💡 **The Real-World Problem**

Many applications need persistent data:

* User accounts
* Uploaded files
* Logs
* Orders, posts, messages
* Any dynamic data

Losing this every time a container changes would be unacceptable.

## 🔑 **So… What Is the Solution?**

👉 **Docker Volumes**
They allow data to live *outside* the container
→ on the host
→ or in volume storage
→ surviving container deletion
