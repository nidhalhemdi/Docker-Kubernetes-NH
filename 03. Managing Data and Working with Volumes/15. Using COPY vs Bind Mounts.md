# **Why do we still use COPY in the Dockerfile if bind mounts overwrite it?**

During development, you typically start your container like this:

```
docker run -v ./app:/app ...
```

This **bind mount** mirrors your local source code into the container.
So you might think:

> “If bind mounts overwrite everything anyway, why do we still use `COPY . /app` in the Dockerfile?”

### ✅ **Yes — during development the COPY is basically useless.**

The bind mount replaces the content with your live source code.

### ❗But here is the key point:

# 🔥 **Bind mounts are ONLY for development — never for production.**

When the application is deployed:

* There’s no local folder to bind mount.
* The code should never change dynamically.
* The server running the container has **no source code folder** next to it.

In production, containers must run based on a **fixed snapshot** of your app.
That fixed snapshot comes from what you include in the **image**, which is built with:

```
COPY . /app
```

This COPY step freezes your code into the image.
That image is what you deploy.

# 🚀 **So why keep COPY? (Super simple explanation)**

| Environment     | Do we use bind mounts? | Do we need COPY in the Dockerfile? | Why                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Development** | Yes                    | It gets overwritten                | So you can edit code and see changes instantly         |
| **Production**  | No                     | **Required**                       | Code must come from the image itself → stable snapshot |

# 🧠 **In short:**

You use bind mounts only during development.
You use the COPY command to build a proper production-ready Docker image.

So **COPY stays in the Dockerfile** because the Dockerfile is used to build the image for production — not just development.
