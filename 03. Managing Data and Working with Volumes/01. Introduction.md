# **Introduction**

### 🔍 **What This Module Covers**

Up to now, we learned:

* What Docker **images** are.
* What Docker **containers** are.
* How Docker runs your **code inside containers**.

Now we move to a new topic:

## 👉 **How to manage data inside images and containers.**

---

# 🧠 Key Ideas

### **1. Not All Data Is the Same**

* We *already* had data inside images/containers (like app code).
* But this is **just one type of data**.
* Real-world apps deal with *multiple* data types:

  * Source code
  * Temporary runtime data
  * Life-long data that must persist (e.g., database files)
  * Configurable values (env vars, build args)

We will soon learn:

* Why the usual way of putting data *inside* a container introduces problems.
* Why persistent and shared data needs special handling.

---

# 🧱 **2. Containers Need Better Data Storage**

Containers are:

* Ephemeral
* Replaceable
* Frequently restarted, recreated, or scaled

⚠️ **Problem:**
If a container is deleted, all data stored *inside* it is lost.

Hence:

### 👉 We need a way to persist data **outside** the container while still allowing the container to read/write it.

This leads to…

# 📂 **3. Docker Volumes (Main Concept of the Module)**

We will learn:

* What volumes are
* Why they are needed
* How to attach host folders to containers
* How to persist application or database state
* How to share data between multiple containers

Docker volumes solve the “data disappears when container stops” problem.

---

# ⚙️ **4. Arguments & Environment Variables**

At the end of the module we will learn:

* **Build arguments (`ARG`)** → used during image build
* **Environment variables (`ENV`)** → used during container runtime

These allow:

* App configuration
* Container customization without rewriting images
* More flexible and portable Docker setups

---

# 📘 What to Expect in the Next Lectures

We will practice:

* Using **bind mounts**
* Using **named volumes**
* Understanding data persistence and isolation
* Passing **environment variables** into containers
* Using **Dockerfile ARG and ENV instructions**

Commands, tips, and best practices will be provided as each lecture progresses.
