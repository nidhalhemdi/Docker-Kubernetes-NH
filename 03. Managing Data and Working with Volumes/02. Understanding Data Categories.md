# **Understanding Data Categories — Summary & Notes**

Docker deals with **3 different kinds of data**, each behaving differently and requiring different solutions.

---

# ✅ 1. **Read-Only Application Data (Source Code + Environment)**

### **What it is**

* Your app code (JS, Python, Go, etc.)
* Third-party dependencies (e.g., `node_modules`)
* Runtime environment set up during Docker build

### **Where it lives**

* **Inside the image**, copied during the Docker build process.
* Defined in **Dockerfile** (via `COPY`, `RUN`, etc.)

### **Characteristics**

* ❗ **Read-only** once the image is built
* ❗ Cannot be changed inside the running container
* ✔ Makes sense because application code shouldn't modify itself
* ✔ If changes are needed → **Rebuild the image**

---

# ✅ 2. **Temporary Application Data**

### **What it is**

Data generated while the container is running that does **not** need to persist:

* Temporary variables (stored in memory)
* Temporary files
* Transient request data (e.g., a user typing into a form)
* Caches or logs that don’t matter long-term

### **Where it lives**

* Stored inside the **container’s writable layer**

  * Docker adds a **read-write layer** on top of the image’s filesystem

### **Characteristics**

* ✔ **Read-write**, but **temporary**
* ✔ It’s fine if this data is lost when the container stops
* ❗ Stored **inside the container only**, not on your computer
* ❗ Lost when the container is removed

### **Important concept: Container Writable Layer**

* The image filesystem is read-only
* Docker adds a **container layer** that tracks changes
* Final filesystem = *image (read-only)* + *container layer (read-write)*

> You haven't worked with writing inside containers yet — you will practice that in this module.

---

# ✅ 3. **Permanent Application Data (Persistent Data)**

### **What it is**

Data that must survive container restarts:

* User accounts
* Database records
* Uploaded files
* Any kind of long-term business data

### **Where it should live**

* Not in images (read-only → impossible)
* Not in container layer (deleted with container)
* Must be stored **outside the container** using:

## 👉 **Docker Volumes (Main Concept)**

### Why volumes?

* Prevent permanent data loss
* Allow containers to be replaced/upgraded without losing data
* Work across multiple containers (e.g., multiple app instances using the same DB files)

### Characteristics

* ✔ **Read-write**
* ✔ **Persistent** even when containers are deleted
* ✔ Managed by Docker
* ✔ Mounted into containers
* ✔ Core focus of this module

# 🧠 Summary Table

| Data Type                   | Stored In            | Read/Write? | Should Persist?            | Example                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **1. App Code (read-only)** | Image                | Read-only   | Yes (as part of the image) | Source code, deps          |
| **2. Temporary Data**       | Container RW Layer   | Read-write  | No                         | Temp files, in-memory data |
| **3. Permanent Data**       | Volume (host system) | Read-write  | Yes                        | DB files, user uploads     |
