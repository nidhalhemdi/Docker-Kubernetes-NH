# **Three Ways to Use `-v` in `docker run`**

When you run a container with `-v`, you can create **one of three types** of storage:

### **1. Anonymous Volume**

```
docker run -v /app/data …
```

* No name given → Docker generates a random name.
* Lives on host, but **deleted automatically** when the container is removed.
* Survives container restarts but **not container removal**.
* Not shareable across containers.
* Good for:

  * Preventing overwriting of existing container-internal data.
  * Offloading data from the container’s read-write layer → slight performance improvement.
  * Temporary data you don’t care about long-term.

---

### **2. Named Volume**

```
docker run -v mydata:/app/data …
```

* You assign a name (e.g., `mydata`).
* **Not tied to any container**.
* Survives:

  * container stop
  * container removal
* Must be deleted manually using Docker commands.
* Shareable across containers.
* Good for:

  * Persistent data (e.g., database files).
  * Sharing data between multiple containers.
  * Keeping data even if you completely rebuild containers.

---

### **3. Bind Mount**

```
docker run -v /absolute/host/path:/app/data …
```

* You use an **absolute path on your machine** → direct mapping.
* Survives forever until you manually delete the folder on your machine.
* Shareable across containers.
* Cannot be deleted via Docker commands (because it’s your real folder).
* Good for:

  * Live development (code changes instantly visible inside container).
  * When you need full control over where data is stored on your system.

# ✅ **Quick Comparison Table**

| Feature                      | Anonymous Volume            | Named Volume             | Bind Mount                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Created automatically?       | Yes                         | No (you specify name)    | No (you specify path)             |
| Survives container removal?  | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Yes                             |
| Shareable across containers? | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Yes                             |
| Can choose host path?        | ❌ No                        | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes                             |
| Deleted with Docker CLI?     | Auto-deleted                | Yes (`docker volume rm`) | ❌ No (delete manually on host)    |
| Good for                     | Temporary or protected data | Persistent app data      | Local development or full control |

# 🎯 **In The Course Context**

* **Anonymous volumes** → useful for container internal data that shouldn’t be overwritten (like temp or pre-existing data).
* **Named volumes** → ideal for app data that must persist (like logs, databases).
* **Bind mounts** → ideal for development, because you edit files on your machine and see changes instantly inside the container.
