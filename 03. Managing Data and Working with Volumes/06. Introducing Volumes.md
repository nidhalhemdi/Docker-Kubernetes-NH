# What Are Docker Volumes?

Volumes are **folders on your host machine** that Docker can **mount** (attach / map) into a container.

This gives you a **persistent place to store data**—data that **survives container deletion**.

---

# 🧠 Why Do We Need Volumes?

From the previous lecture:

* A container has its own internal filesystem.
* When the container is **deleted**, that internal filesystem disappears.
* So all data created inside the container is lost.

Volumes solve this problem by storing the data **outside** the container.

# 📁 How Volumes Work (Easy Version)

A *volume* is:

* A folder on your host machine
* That Docker manages
* And connects (mounts) to a specific folder inside the container

### 🔄 What happens when you connect the two folders?

* If the container writes a file → it appears on your host
* If you change something on your host → the container immediately sees it
* The two folders stay synced
* The volume persists even if the container is deleted

This is **NOT** like the `COPY` instruction from Dockerfile (which only copies once and then stops).

Volumes provide a **live connection**, not a snapshot.

# 💡 Why Volumes Are Powerful

### 👉 They allow **persistent data**

Even if the container is removed, the volume (and its data) remains untouched.

### 👉 They allow **two-way sharing**

Host ↔ Container automatically stay in sync.

### 👉 They allow **isolation**

Different containers can share the same volume or use separate ones.

# 🧱 Summary

**Volumes = persistent storage for Docker containers.**
They let you store data outside the container so that:

* Stopping a container ✔ keeps the data
* Deleting a container ✔ keeps the data
* Rebuilding containers ✔ keeps the data

This is essential for:

* Databases
* User uploads
* Logs
* Config files
* Anything you don’t want to lose
