# **Analyzing a Real App — Summary & Notes**

This lecture introduces a **real Node.js application** that demonstrates the **three types of data** discussed earlier and prepares us to dockerize it. The goal is to *see the data problems firsthand* and then solve them using Docker tools (volumes, bind mounts, etc.).

---

# 🧠 **What the Example App Does**

The instructor prepared a small Node.js/Express app that includes:

* A server (`server.js`)
* HTML pages returned from routes
* A simple form to submit feedback
* Logic for storing feedback in files

When run:

* You get a UI with a **feedback form**
* When you submit feedback → it gets stored into files

---

# 📂 **Folder Structure Overview**

The project includes:

```
/pages
    - HTML pages returned by the server (e.g., feedback.html)
/public
    - CSS and static assets
/temp
    - Temporary feedback files
/feedback
    - Permanent feedback files
server.js
```

---

# 🔍 **How the Feedback Storage Works**

When feedback is submitted:

1. **Temporary file created**

   * A file is first written to the `/temp` folder
   * This represents **temporary data**

2. **Check for existing final file**

   * The app checks if a file with the same name already exists in `/feedback`

3. **Copy to final folder**

   * If not existing, temp file → copied into the `/feedback` folder
   * This file becomes **permanent data**

---

# 🎯 **Why This App Is Useful for the Module**

This example clearly shows all **three data types** inside a single real project:

### ✔ 1. **Application Code**

Stored in:

* `server.js`
* `/pages`
* `/public`
  → part of the Docker image (read-only)

### ✔ 2. **Temporary Data**

Stored in:

* `/temp`
  → created at runtime, okay to lose

### ✔ 3. **Permanent Data**

Stored in:

* `/feedback`
  → must not be lost when container restarts

---

# 🐳 **Why dockerize this app?**

Dockerizing this project will show you **common real problems**:

* Temporary and permanent data disappearing after container restarts
* Files not being accessible between container rebuilds
* Needing to persist data outside the container layer
* Understanding where Docker stores files internally

You’ll then fix these issues using:

* **Bind mounts**
* **Named volumes**
* **Volume commands**
* And later: environment variables

---

# 🚀 Next Steps

In the upcoming lectures you will:

* Build a Dockerfile for this app
* Run it inside a container
* Observe what happens to the `/temp` and `/feedback` folders
* Solve data persistence using volumes
