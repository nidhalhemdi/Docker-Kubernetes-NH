# **1. Key Idea: Volumes Are Managed by Docker**

When you run a container that uses a **named** or **anonymous** volume:

```
-v feedback:/app/feedback
-v /app/node_modules
-v /app/temp
```

Docker will automatically:

* create the volume if it doesn’t exist
* store it in a location **inside Docker’s internal storage**, not directly in your computer’s file system
* manage its lifecycle

You don’t need to create volumes yourself — Docker normally does it automatically.

---

# 📌 **2. How to See All Volumes**

Command:

```
docker volume ls
```

This lists:

* **named volumes** → human names (e.g., `feedback`)
* **anonymous volumes** → long random names (e.g., `a84f381a81e0d17...`)

👉 Bind mounts (like mounting your project folder) **do NOT appear here** because they are *not* Docker-managed.

---

# 📌 **3. Creating Volumes Manually**

You *can* create a named volume yourself:

```
docker volume create feedback-files
```

But normally you don’t need to — Docker auto-creates volumes when needed.

---

# 📌 **4. Inspecting a Volume**

Command:

```
docker volume inspect feedback
```

This shows:

* **name**
* **created date**
* **mountpoint**
  → The folder inside Docker’s virtual filesystem
  (not directly on your host OS!)

### Important:

Even though the mountpoint looks like a normal path:

```
/var/lib/docker/volumes/feedback/_data
```

This is **inside Docker’s internal VM**, not your Windows/macOS/Linux file system.

That’s why you can’t directly browse to it on your PC.

---

# 📌 **5. Deleting Volumes**

Deleting a volume:

```
docker volume rm feedback
```

⚠️ But if the volume is currently used by a running container, you get an error:

```
Error: volume is in use
```

You must stop the container first.

⚠️ **Warning:** Deleting a volume destroys all data stored in it permanently.

---

# 📌 **6. What Happens When You Delete a Volume and Restart the Container**

Your app stored files (e.g., `feedback-awesome.txt`) in the volume.

You delete the volume:

```
docker volume rm feedback
```

Then restart the container → a **new empty volume** is created.

Result:

* The app can no longer find the old feedback files
* The data is lost forever

---

# 📌 **7. Anonymous Volumes and Auto-Cleanup**

Anonymous volumes are created like this:

```
-v /app/node_modules
-v /app/temp
```

**Anonymous volumes are deleted automatically when the container is removed**, *if* you run the container with:

```
--rm
```

And since the lecture's container uses `--rm`, the anonymous volumes disappear every time the container stops.

---

# 📌 **8. Removing All Unused Volumes**

Command:

```
docker volume prune
```

This deletes *all* unused volumes (be careful!).

---

# 🧠 **Core Takeaways**

### ✔ Named volumes

* Persist until you manually delete them
* Survive container removal
* Good for important app data (DB data, user files, logs)

### ✔ Anonymous volumes

* Tied to a specific container
* Deleted automatically when the container is removed (if `--rm` is used)
* Good for container-internal data like `node_modules`

### ✔ Bind mounts

* Not Docker-managed
* Don't appear in `docker volume ls`

### ✔ You can:

* list volumes
* inspect volumes
* create volumes manually
* remove volumes manually
* prune unused volumes
