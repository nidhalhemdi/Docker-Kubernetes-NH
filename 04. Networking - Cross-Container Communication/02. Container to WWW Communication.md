# **Case 1 — Container → WWW Communication**

### **Core Concept**

- Explaining **how a container sends requests to the outside world**—specifically the **World Wide Web**.

### **Scenario**

You have an application inside a container:

* Could be **Node.js**, **Python**, **PHP**, etc.
* As part of its logic, it wants to talk to an **external API** (not owned by you, not in another container).

Example:
Your app sends a **GET HTTP request** to **swapi.dev** (Star Wars API).

### **Key Point**

A containerized application **must still be able to reach external websites**.
Docker must allow **outbound HTTP requests** to the internet.

### **Example Used**

A simple **Node.js app** using **Axios**:

* Sends GET request to:
  `https://swapi.dev/api/films`
* The app itself will later run inside a container.
* That container must be able to reach **swapi.dev** to fetch data.

### **Important Definitions (Simple Terms)**

* **Outbound request**: Request going *from the container → to the internet*.
* **External API**: A web service not owned by you and not part of your Docker environment.
* **Axios**: A Node.js library for sending HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).

### **Why This Matters**

Once you containerize your app:

* The app still needs to contact external APIs.
* Docker provides networking features that allow containers to talk to the [WWW](http://WWW).
* This is the **first communication type** covered in this module.

### **Tips / What to Remember**

* Containers **can send outbound traffic by default** (no special config needed in most cases).
* If the app needs internet access, ensure:

  * No custom Docker network is blocking outbound requests.
  * No firewall rules prevent container traffic.
