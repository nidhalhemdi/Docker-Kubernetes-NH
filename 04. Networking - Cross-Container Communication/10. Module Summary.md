# **Module Summary — Networking & Container Communication**

This module covered the **three types of communication** that matter when working with Docker containers:

---

## **1️⃣ Container → Web (WWW)**

✔ Works **out of the box**
✔ No special configuration needed
✔ Containers can freely access external APIs and websites

---

## **2️⃣ Container → Host Machine**

Use the special domain:

### 👉 **`host.docker.internal`**

Docker translates it to the host machine’s IP address, allowing the container to communicate with services running directly on your computer (e.g., a locally installed MongoDB).

---

## **3️⃣ Container → Container**

Two approaches:

### **❌ Basic way (not recommended)**

Look up the other container’s IP via:

```
docker container inspect
```

Then hardcode the IP.
This is inconvenient and breaks whenever the container restarts.

### **✅ Best way — Use Docker Networks**

* Create a network:

  ```
  docker network create my-network
  ```
* Start containers with:

  ```
  docker run --network my-network ...
  ```
* Inside your code, use **the container name** as the hostname:

  ```
  mongodb://mongodb:27017
  ```

Docker resolves the container name to the correct IP automatically.

This is the normal and recommended way to handle multi-container communication.

# **What’s Next?**

In the next module, you’ll solve a key issue:

👉 **Data loss in MongoDB when the container stops**
This will be handled using **volumes** and combined with other multi-container best practices.

# **Core Takeaways**

* 🌐 Web requests: **Always allowed and straightforward**
* 🖥 Container → Host: Use **`host.docker.internal`**
* 🔗 Container → Container: Prefer **Docker networks** and container names
