# **How Docker Resolves IP Addresses**

This lecture clarifies **how Docker’s automatic address/IP resolution actually works** when containers communicate with the host or with each other.

---

# 🚫 **Important Misconception**

Docker **does NOT** read or modify your **source code**.

❌ It does *not* scan your code
❌ It does *not* replace container names with IPs inside your files
❌ It does *not* rewrite connection strings

This would be extremely complicated and unsafe, so Docker does **not** do this.

---

# ✅ **What Docker Actually Does**

Docker controls the **network environment** around your container.

So when your application sends a request (HTTP, DB, etc.) to:

* **`host.docker.internal`** → host machine
* **a container name** → another container in the same network

Docker sees that a request *is leaving a container*, and at *that moment* it resolves the address to the correct IP.

### ✔ Docker resolves names at **runtime**, not in your code.

### ✔ It intercepts outbound network requests and maps them to the correct IP.

---

# 🔍 **When Docker Resolves the Address**

### Docker *does* resolve names when:

* Your app in the container sends a request outward
* e.g. Node app → MongoDB container
* e.g. Node app → host machine service

### Docker *does NOT* resolve anything when:

* Requests come **from the browser**
* Requests come **from outside Docker**
* Requests happen entirely **inside the container**

Because Docker cannot intercept traffic outside its environment.

# 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **Docker resolves container names and `host.docker.internal` only when a request leaves a container. It does not rewrite or modify your source code.**

This automatic resolution works because Docker controls the runtime networking environment of each container.
