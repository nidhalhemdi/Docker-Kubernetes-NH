# **Introduction — Summary & Key Points**

## **What This Module Is About**

You’ve learned:

* Images & containers
* Persisting data with volumes

Now we move to the **next major Docker concept: networking**.

## **What You Will Learn in This Module**

The focus is understanding **how containers communicate**, including:

### **1. Container-to-Container Communication**

* How multiple containers can talk to each other.
* How services inside different containers can interact (e.g., app ↔ database).

### **2. Container-to-Host Communication**

* How an application running **inside a container** can reach your **local machine**.
* Example: sending HTTP requests from a containerized app to a server running locally.

#### **3. Container-to-Internet Communication**

* How containers can access the outside world (e.g., call external APIs).

### **4. Different Docker Network Types**

This module will explain:

* What networks exist in Docker.
* When to use each one.
* How to choose the right network setup.

## **Simple Definitions**

* **Docker Network**: A virtual network created by Docker that lets containers communicate.
* **Cross-container communication**: Two or more containers exchanging data.
* **Host access**: A container reaching services running on your computer.
* **Outbound access**: Container sending requests to the internet.
