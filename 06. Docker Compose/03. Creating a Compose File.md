# **Creating a Compose File**

---

# 🚀 **Goal of This Lecture**

You learn how to **create the initial structure of a `docker-compose.yml` file** and how YAML indentation works.

This is the **foundation** before adding container configurations.

---

# 📁 **1. Create the `docker-compose.yml` File**

Inside your project **root folder**, create:

```
docker-compose.yml
```

You can name it either:

* `docker-compose.yml`
* `docker-compose.yaml`

Both work (YAML extension can be `.yml` or `.yaml`).

---

# 🧾 **2. YAML Basics**

YAML uses:

* **Indentation = structure**
* **No curly braces**, no parentheses
* Indentation uses **spaces** (NOT tabs)

Example:

```
parent:
  child1:
  child2:
```

Everything indented under `parent:` belongs to it.

---

# 🧩 **3. Start with the Compose File Structure**

A minimal Compose file always begins with:

### **A. Version**

Defines which Docker Compose specification your file uses.

Example:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
```

This tells Docker which syntax and features are allowed.

> Note: For most projects, version 3.x or latest is fine.

---

### **B. Services**

This is the **main section**.
Here you define **each container** in your application.

```yaml
services:
```

Under `services:` you list each container (service) by a name YOU choose.

---

# 🧱 **4. Add Your Containers (Services)**

Your app has **3 containers**, so under `services:` you define:

```
services:
  mongodb:
  backend:
  frontend:
```

These names are arbitrary—but descriptive names are recommended.

Each service:

* must be indented
* must be at the same indentation level
* represents **one container**

---

# 📐 **5. Add Configuration Blocks Under Each Service**

Each service gets its own sub-configuration by **adding another level of indentation**:

Example structure:

```yaml
services:
  mongodb:
    # configuration for MongoDB (ports, volumes, image, environment...)
    
  backend:
    # configuration for the Node.js API

  frontend:
    # configuration for React frontend
```

Indentation rules:

* 2 spaces for each level
* Services are children of `services:`
* Their configuration options are children of the service name

---

# 🎯 **6. What Comes Next?**

You haven’t yet added config (like `image`, `build`, `ports`, `volumes`, etc.).
That will be done in the next lectures.

The purpose here was to:

✔ Create the file
✔ Set the Compose version
✔ Define the `services:` block
✔ Add the 3 service entries
✔ Understand YAML indentation

---

# 📌 **Example Result So Far**

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  mongodb:
    # config will go here

  backend:
    # config will go here

  frontend:
    # config will go here
```
