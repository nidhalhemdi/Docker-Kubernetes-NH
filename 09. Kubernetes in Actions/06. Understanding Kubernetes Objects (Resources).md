# **Kubernetes Objects & Pods**

Now that Minikube is running, we can start interacting with Kubernetes.
To do that effectively, we need to understand the **objects** (also called *resources*) Kubernetes works with.

---

## 🧩 1. Kubernetes Works With “Objects”

Kubernetes doesn’t simply run containers by itself.
Instead, you **create objects**, and Kubernetes interprets them to do something.

Examples of Kubernetes objects:

* **Pods**
* **Deployments**
* **Services**
* **Volumes**
* …and many more

Each object type has a purpose and instructions attached.

There are **two ways to create objects**:

1. **Imperatively** → run commands that create objects directly
2. **Declaratively** → write YAML files and tell Kubernetes to apply them

You’ll learn both, starting with the *imperative* approach.

# 🟦 **2. The Pod: The Smallest Kubernetes Unit**

A **pod** is the smallest resource Kubernetes manages.

### A Pod:

* Holds **one** or **multiple containers**
* Runs those containers on a worker node
* Has its own **cluster-internal IP address**

While multiple containers *can* live inside one pod,
👉 **the most common pattern is 1 container per pod**.

---

# 🔌 **3. Pod Communication & Networking**

* Containers inside the **same pod** communicate via `localhost`
* Pods communicate using their **internal cluster IP**
* External access is possible, but requires additional resources like **Services** (covered later)

📝 Analogy:
If you’ve used AWS ECS, a **task** is similar to a **pod**—a wrapper around containers.

---

# 💾 **4. Pods Are Ephemeral**

**Ephemeral** means:

* They **do not persist**
* If removed or replaced, **all data is lost**

This is intentional — just like Docker containers.

To persist data, Kubernetes uses **Volumes**, which you’ll learn later.

---

# 🎯 **5. You Typically Don’t Create Pods Directly**

Even though you *can* create pods manually, this is **not how Kubernetes is meant to be used**.

Why?

Because you want Kubernetes to:

* restart failed pods
* replace unhealthy pods
* scale the number of pods
* ensure your desired number of pods is always running

To get this behavior, you use **controller objects**, the most important one being:

### 👉 **Deployment**

A **Deployment** manages pods for you:

* creates them
* replaces them
* scales them
* keeps them running and healthy

This is the real power of Kubernetes.

---

# 📌 **Key Takeaways**

* Kubernetes uses **objects** to perform actions.
* A **pod** is the smallest unit and holds containers.
* Pods:

  * can contain one or more containers
  * have internal IPs
  * lose all data when removed
  * are usually not created manually
* Instead, you use **Deployments**, which manage pods automatically.
