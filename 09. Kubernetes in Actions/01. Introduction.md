# **Module Introduction**

---

## ✅ **What This Module Is About**

This module moves from Kubernetes theory → **actual hands-on work**.
You will **set up Kubernetes locally**, create and manage **Kubernetes objects**, and deploy a **real basic app**.

---

## ✅ **Key Ideas**

### **Kubernetes Testing Environment**

A local setup where you can run a small Kubernetes cluster.
Examples:

* **Minikube**
* **Docker Desktop Kubernetes**
  This lets you test everything on your machine before deploying to the cloud.

### **Kubernetes Objects**

Everything you create/configure in Kubernetes is an *object*.
Examples you’ll learn in this module:

* **Deployment** → manages running app instances (Pods)
* **Pod** → smallest unit, runs containers
* **Service** → exposes Pods to the network
* **ConfigMap / Secret** → store configuration
* **Ingress** → routing from outside world
  Kubernetes uses YAML files to define these objects.

### **Deployment**

A Kubernetes object that ensures a certain number of Pods are running.
If a Pod crashes → the Deployment recreates it automatically.

---

## ✅ **What You Will Do in This Module**

* Install/setup a **local Kubernetes cluster**
* Learn the main **Kubernetes object types**
* Create your **first Deployment**
* Deploy a **full basic application** locally
* Understand how the same config can be reused for cloud providers (GKE, EKS, AKS, etc.)

## 🛠️ **Expected Commands / Actions in This Module**

(Not used in this intro lecture but highly likely in the next ones)

You will eventually run commands like:

```sh
kubectl version
kubectl get nodes
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete deployment my-app
```

And you’ll create YAML files such as:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
```
