# **Kubernetes does NOT manage your Infrastructure**

---

# **Core Idea**

**Kubernetes manages your *containers*, NOT your servers.**
You must create and manage the underlying machines (nodes) yourself — unless you use an external tool or a managed cloud service.

---

# **What Kubernetes *Does***

Kubernetes is responsible for **orchestrating containers**, specifically:

* Running containers inside **Pods**
* Monitoring containers
* Restarting failed Pods
* Scaling Pods up or down
* Scheduling Pods across worker nodes
* Ensuring apps remain accessible

👉 Kubernetes **uses** the resources you provide (nodes), but **does not create or manage** those resources.

---

# ❌ **What Kubernetes Does *NOT* Do**

Kubernetes will **NOT**:

* Create servers, VMs, or cloud instances
* Install the Kubernetes control plane on those servers
* Install kubelets on worker nodes
* Configure networks, security groups, load balancers
* Update or secure operating systems
* Manage data centers or server hardware

👉 These tasks remain **your responsibility** or the responsibility of a separate tool.

---

# **Your Job (If No Managed Service Is Used)**

You must:

1. **Create master + worker nodes**

   * Physical machines or cloud VMs (AWS EC2, etc.)
2. **Install Kubernetes components**

   * API server (master)
   * Scheduler, controller manager
   * kubelet (workers)
   * kube-proxy
3. **Set up networking + security**
4. **Maintain and update OS + cluster**

---

# ⭐ **Why This Matters**

It's easy to mistakenly believe "Kubernetes deploys infrastructure."

**Reality:** Kubernetes sits *on top* of infrastructure → it orchestrates containers, not machines.

# 🛠️ **Tools That *Can* Manage Infrastructure for You**

### **1. Kubermatic**

* External tool (NOT part of Kubernetes)
* Helps create and manage cluster infrastructure on cloud providers
* Automates node creation, OS setup, Kubernetes installation

### **2. Cloud Managed Services**

Examples:

* **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
* **GCP GKE**
* **Azure AKS**

These services:

* Create master nodes for you
* Set up Kubernetes components
* Manage updates and security

You only bring:

* Your Kubernetes YAML configuration
* Your application containers

---

# 🎯 **Takeaway**

Kubernetes = **container orchestrator**, not infrastructure provider.

For infrastructure:

* Do it manually
* Use automation tools (Kubermatic)
* OR use managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS)
