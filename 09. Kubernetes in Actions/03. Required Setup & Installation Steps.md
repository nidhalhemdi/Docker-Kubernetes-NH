# **What You Need to Run Kubernetes Locally**

To work with Kubernetes (locally or in the cloud), you must set up:

---

# **1. A Kubernetes Cluster**

A cluster contains:

### **Master Node**

Runs Kubernetes control-plane components:

* **API Server**
* **Scheduler**
* **Controller Manager**
* Other Kubernetes services

### **Worker Nodes**

Each worker node must have:

* **Docker** (or container runtime)
* **kubelet** (agent that talks to the master)
* **kube-proxy**
* Networking components

👉 **You must install this software on the nodes. Kubernetes does NOT install it for you.**

---

# **2. kubectl (Kube-Control)**

This is the **CLI tool** you install on your local machine to **control Kubernetes**.

### You use `kubectl` to:

* Create deployments
* Scale pods
* Delete/update resources
* Query the cluster state

### Important:

* `kubectl` ≠ API server
* `kubectl` ≠ master node

**kubectl = command sender**
**Master node = command executor**
**Worker nodes = where containers actually run**

---

# 🧠 **Analogy Used**

* **kubectl** → like the president giving commands
* **Master node** → generals who apply the orders
* **Worker nodes** → soldiers executing them

Just to illustrate the hierarchy.

# **3. For Local Testing: Minikube**

Since setting up a full multi-node cluster manually is complex, we will use:

### **Minikube**

A tool that:

* Runs a **virtual machine** on your computer
* Creates a **single-node cluster** inside it
  (master + worker combined → OK for development)
* Allows you to experiment with Kubernetes locally

### Key Notes:

* Works on **Windows, macOS, Linux**
* Still requires **kubectl** → Minikube does *not* replace it
* Very resource friendly and perfect for learning/testing

---

# 🔧 **What You Will Install**

1. **kubectl**
2. **minikube**

Minikube = creates the cluster
kubectl = allows you to communicate with the cluster

---

# ⚙️ **Flow of How You Will Work**

1. Install `kubectl`
2. Install Minikube
3. Start the cluster (Minikube VM)
4. Use `kubectl` to deploy and manage applications inside the Minikube cluster
