# **Installing Minikube & kubectl on Windows**

This lecture guides you through installing the tools needed to run a **local Kubernetes cluster** on Windows using **Minikube** and **kubectl**.

---

## 🔧 **1. Requirements Check**

Minikube needs a **hypervisor** (virtualization technology).

* Run the verification command from the official docs in PowerShell or command prompt:
```sh
systeminfo
```
* Possible outcomes:

  * ✔️ **“A hypervisor has been detected”** → You're good to go.
  * ⚠️ **“System supports virtualization but no hypervisor installed”** → You must install one (e.g., VirtualBox).

If virtualization isn't supported, Minikube cannot be installed.

---

## 📦 **2. Install kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)**

You need this tool even if you don't use Minikube, because it communicates with any Kubernetes cluster.

Preferred method shown: **Chocolatey** package manager.

### Steps:

1. Install Chocolatey by running the provided PowerShell script (from official site).
2. Install kubectl:

   ```
   choco install kubernetes-cli
   ```
3. Verify installation:

   ```
   kubectl version --client
   ```

---

## 📁 **3. Prepare .kube Folder**

These steps ensure kubectl has a place to store its config:

1. In Command Prompt:

   ```
   cd %USERPROFILE%
   mkdir .kube
   ```
2. In the `.kube` folder, create a file named **config** (no extension).
   You can leave it empty for now.

## 🧰 **4. Install a Hypervisor**

Two options:

### **Option A (Recommended for Windows Home): VirtualBox**

Download from VirtualBox site → install → done.

### **Option B: Hyper-V**

Built into Windows Pro/Enterprise.

---

## 🚀 **5. Install Minikube**

Installed with Chocolatey:

```
choco install minikube
```

Restart your terminal afterward.

---

## ▶️ **6. Start Minikube (Create the Local Cluster)**

Use the driver matching your hypervisor:

### Example for VirtualBox:

```
minikube start --driver=virtualbox
```

### Example for Hyper-V:

```
minikube start --driver=hyperv
```

Notes:

* If VirtualBox fails due to Hyper-V being enabled, disable Hyper-V **or** just use `--driver=hyperv`.
* Use Administrator PowerShell if required.

Minikube will create:

* A local VM
* A Kubernetes node (master+worker combined)
* All essential Kubernetes components inside the VM

This process may take a few minutes.

---

## ✔️ **7. Verify Everything Works**

Check Minikube status:

```
minikube status
```

You should see several components as **Running**.

---

## 📊 **8. Optional: Use Minikube Dashboard**

```
minikube dashboard
```

This opens a web interface showing cluster resources.

* At this point, you’ll see **no pods** yet because nothing has been deployed.

Stop dashboard with **Ctrl + C** (twice).

# 🎉 You're Ready to Use Kubernetes Locally

With **kubectl** and **Minikube** installed, you can now follow the upcoming lectures to deploy workloads, see pods running, create services, and more.
