# **Imperative vs Declarative Approach in Kubernetes**

### **Imperative Approach**

* You tell Kubernetes *what to do step-by-step*, by running commands manually.
* Examples:

  * `kubectl create deployment`
  * `kubectl set image`
  * `kubectl expose`
* Similar to using **`docker run` repeatedly** for each container.
* Downsides:

  * You must remember commands.
  * You must execute them repeatedly, especially for complex applications.

### **Declarative Approach**

* You define *the desired final state* of your application in YAML files (resource definition files).
* Kubernetes then applies whatever changes are needed to match that state.
* Uses the command:

  * `kubectl apply -f <file.yaml>`
* Example resource files:

  * Deployment configuration
  * Service configuration
* Benefits:

  * Store your configuration in files.
  * Easy to reproduce and version-control your cluster setup.
  * Similar to **Docker Compose**, where you define everything in a YAML file.

### **How It Works**

* You write YAML files describing:

  * Deployments
  * Containers and images
  * Replicas
  * Services
  * Other Kubernetes objects
* Running `kubectl apply`:

  * Creates those resources if they don't exist.
  * Updates them if they already exist (compares target state with current state).
* If you edit the YAML file and re-run `apply`, Kubernetes adjusts the cluster automatically.

### **Analogy**

* **Imperative:** “Do this, then this, then this.”
* **Declarative:** “Here’s how things should look — make it happen.”
