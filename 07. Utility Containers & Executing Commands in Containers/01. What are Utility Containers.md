# **Working with "Utility Containers" & Executing Commands inside Containers**

## **Module Introduction & What Are Utility Containers?**

---

# ✅ **Key Idea of This Module**

Until now, you used Docker mainly for **running full applications** (Node API, React app, DB, etc.).
But Docker can also be used as a **toolbox** to run **tasks** using temporary containers.

This module introduces **utility containers** — a very useful workflow!

# 🧰 **What Are Utility Containers?**

### ⭐ **Utility Container = A container used ONLY to run commands/tasks, not to run an app.**

They:

* contain an environment (Node, PHP, Python, etc.)
* **do NOT automatically start an application**
* are used to **run commands on demand**, e.g.:

  * running Node scripts
  * running linters or formatters
  * running build steps
  * running composer/npm commands
  * running migrations
  * running CLI tools

### 💡 Important difference:

| Application Container                 | Utility Container                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Runs your app                         | Runs a command you pass manually   |
| Has ENTRYPOINT/CMD that starts server | Often idle unless you pass command |
| Long-running                          | Short-lived                        |

# 🔍 **Why This Is Useful**

Utility containers let you run tools **without installing them on your machine**.

Examples:

* Need Node? → Use a Node container
* Need PHP? → Use a PHP container
* Need MySQL client? → Use a MySQL container

This keeps your system clean and avoids conflicts.

# 🧪 **New Syntax You’ll Learn**

### 👉 **Run a container AND a command:**

```bash
docker run <image> <command>
```

Examples:

```bash
docker run node node -v
docker run php php -v
docker run python python script.py
```

Here:

* `node` is the image
* `node -v` is the command executed **inside** the container

The container runs → executes the command → exits.

# 🌟 **Why we Call Them "Utility Containers"**

It's not an official Docker term.
He uses it because these containers act like **tools** or **utilities**, not applications.

You’re basically using Docker as:

* a **Node environment**
* a **PHP environment**
* a **Python runner**
* a **build tool**
* a **command executor**

---

# 📝 **Core Concepts To Remember**

**1. Docker is not only for apps — it can run tools.**
**2. A utility container is just an image + a command you provide.**
**3. They don’t start long-running apps.**
**4. The command you write after the image name overrides CMD in the Dockerfile.**
**5. Perfect for short tasks, builds, scripts, and CLI tools.**

# 🧠 **Tips & Practical Methods**

### ✔ Tip 1 — Use `docker run --rm`

Useful for disposable utility containers:

```bash
docker run --rm node npm install
```

### ✔ Tip 2 — Bind mount your project folder

You will learn more later, but preview:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app node npm install
```

### ✔ Tip 3 — Avoid installing tools locally

Prefer:

```bash
docker run node npx eslint .
```
