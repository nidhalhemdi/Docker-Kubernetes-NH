# **Docker & Kubernetes Notes, Examples, and Mini Projects**

This repository is my personal documentation space for everything I learn and practice in Docker and Kubernetes. It includes concepts, commands, workflows, troubleshooting notes, and practical examples—all written in clear, simple Markdown files.

What started as a place to store the things I often revisit has become a structured guide that others learning containerization and orchestration may also find useful.
