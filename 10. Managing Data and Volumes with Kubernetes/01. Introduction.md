# **Managing Data and Volumes with Kubernetes**

### ** Introduction — Summary & Key Concepts**

## ✅ **What This Module Is About**

In this section, you learn **how to manage data** in Kubernetes—specifically how to make container-generated data **survive pod restarts, scaling, rescheduling, or node failure**.

Kubernetes runs containers inside **Pods**, and Pods are not permanent. They can be:

* Restarted
* Replaced
* Moved to another Node
* Scaled up or down

➡️ **Any data stored inside a Pod disappears when the Pod disappears.**
This is the same problem we had with Docker containers.

Therefore, we need **Volumes**.

## 📌 **Topics You Will Learn**

1. **Regular Volumes in Kubernetes**

   * Similar idea to Docker volumes
   * But still tied to the Pod lifecycle (data may be lost)

2. **Persistent Volumes (PV)**

   * Independent storage resource in the cluster
   * Not deleted when Pods die

3. **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**

   * A request from an application (Pod) for storage
   * Pods get storage through PVCs
   * PVCs are the bridge between Pods and PVs

4. **Environment Variables in Kubernetes**

   * Defining configuration values for containers
   * Useful for secrets, API keys, database URLs, etc.

## 🧠 **Key Concepts (Easy Definitions)**

### **Pod**

A wrapper around 1+ containers.
**Pods die → data inside the container dies.**

### **Volume**

A filesystem mounted into a Pod to store data.
**Basic Kubernetes volumes do NOT survive Pod removal.**

### **Persistent Volume (PV)**

A cluster-level storage resource (like a disk).
Does NOT depend on any Pod.
**Survives Pod deletion.**

### **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**

A request by a Pod for storage.
Kubernetes binds the PVC → PV.

### **Why PV + PVC?**

Because Pods should not care **how** storage is provided.
They should only say **"I need X GB"**, Kubernetes finds the storage.

## 🔧 **Tips & Important Ideas**

* Kubernetes clusters often run on **multiple machines (nodes)**, so storage must not depend on one specific node.
* If a Pod is moved from Node A to Node B, its data must follow it → **persistent storage needed**.
* Kubernetes storage is more complex than Docker storage because:

  * Pods are ephemeral
  * Pods move across nodes
  * Storage must be abstracted & decoupled
