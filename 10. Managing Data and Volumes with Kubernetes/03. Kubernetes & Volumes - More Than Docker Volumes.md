# **Kubernetes & Volumes — More Than Docker Volumes**

## ✅ **Core Idea**

Before learning Kubernetes volumes, we need to understand **state**—data that must be preserved even when containers stop or restart.

---

## 📌 **Definition: State**

**State = important data created or used by your application that must not be lost.**

There are two major categories:

### **1. User-Generated Data (Must Never Be Lost)**

Examples:

* User accounts
* Uploaded files
* Saved stories (like the `/story` example)
* Database records

Usually stored in:

* Databases
* Files on disk

### **2. Intermediate / Temporary Data**

Examples:

* Cached results
* Temp files
* Data in memory
* Temporary DB tables

This type may not need long-term persistence, but is still important while the app runs.

---

## 🧠 **Why We Need Volumes**

Because containers are **ephemeral**:

* They restart
* They get replaced
* They are removed during updates
* They move between machines in Kubernetes

➡️ **Without volumes, all data inside a container would be lost.**

You already saw this with Docker + Docker Compose.

---

## 🐳 **Docker vs Kubernetes Perspective**

### **With Docker**

You control containers directly using:

* `docker run -v ...`
* `docker compose` with `volumes:` section

So you manually attach volumes.

---

### **With Kubernetes**

You **do NOT** start containers yourself.

Kubernetes:

* Schedules Pods
* Starts containers inside those Pods
* Decides where Pods run (which Node)
* Restarts or replaces Pods automatically

➡️ You cannot run `docker run -v ...`.
➡️ You cannot use `docker-compose.yml`.

Therefore:

### **Kubernetes must be configured to add volumes automatically to the Pods it creates.**

And that is what this module teaches:

* How to define volumes in Pod specs
* How to persist data across Pod restarts
* How to use Persistent Volumes (PV)
* How to use Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

---

## 🧩 **Key Point to Remember**

Even though we are now using Kubernetes:

* We still rely on volumes
* The need for persistent storage does NOT change
* Only **how we define and attach** volumes changes

Kubernetes becomes the system responsible for:

* Creating Pods
* Running containers
* Attaching volumes
* Maintaining data durability across the cluster
