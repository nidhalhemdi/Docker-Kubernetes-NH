# 🚀 “Getting Started with Kubernetes Volumes”

### **Why do we suddenly care about volumes again?**

You just deployed your **story application** in Kubernetes. Everything works fine… **until the Pod is restarted**.

### ❗ **The problem**

Inside your container, the app stores data **locally** in the container’s filesystem.

But in Kubernetes:

* A **Pod can restart at any time** (crash, timeout, resource pressure, node reboot, etc.).
* When a Pod restarts, its containers are recreated **from scratch**.
* **Container-local filesystem = erased**
  → All your story data disappears.

This is exactly the same problem we saw in Docker before we introduced volumes.

# 🧠 Why Kubernetes volumes are more complex than Docker volumes

Docker volumes were simple because everything happened on **your local machine**.

Kubernetes is different:

* Pods can run on **any worker node**
* Pods can move to **other nodes**
* Kubernetes clusters run on various environments:

  * local Minikube VM
  * AWS (EBS, EFS)
  * Azure (Disk, File Storage)
  * Google Cloud (Persistent Disk)
  * On-prem machines
* **Different storage backends** → different volume types

Therefore, Kubernetes includes **many volume drivers**, and that's why the doc list looks huge.

# 🗂 Volume types mentioned in the lecture

In this course, you focus on **just 3 types**:

### 1️⃣ **emptyDir**

* Lives as long as the **Pod** lives
* Stored on the **node’s temporary storage**
* Data is deleted when the Pod is deleted
* Good for caching, temporary scratch space
  ➡️ Not persistent across Pod restarts.

### 2️⃣ **hostPath**

* Volume points to a path **on the node’s filesystem**
* Survives container restarts
* But only works if the Pod stays on the same node
  ➡️ NOT good for production clusters.

### 3️⃣ **CSI volumes**

* **Modern, extensible** method for storage plugins
* Used for cloud block storage (AWS EBS, Azure Disk, etc.)
* Used for **PersistentVolumes (PV)** and **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)**
  ➡️ This is what real production storage uses.

# 🧩 Important clarification from the lecture

Regardless of the type:

* **Inside the container**, a volume is always just a **mounted folder path**
* Everything beyond the container (how it is stored) depends on the selected **volume type**
  → Just like Docker, but with more backends.

---

# 🎯 What’s next?

You will now learn how to:

* Configure an **emptyDir** volume inside a Pod template
* Understand how Kubernetes mounts it into containers
* See how it behaves during restarts

After that, the course will gradually move to **persistent** volumes.
