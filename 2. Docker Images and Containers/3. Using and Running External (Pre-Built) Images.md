# **Using & Running External (Pre-Built) Docker Images**

## 🔹 Why External Images?

There are **two ways to get an image**:

1. Build your own (later)
2. **Use existing images**:

   * Official images (maintained by software teams)
   * Community images
   * Shared images from teammates

The most common source: **Docker Hub** (hub.docker.com)

Example search: `node` → official Node.js image.

---

## 🔹 Running an External Image

To use a pre-built image, simply run:

```bash
docker run <image-name>
```

Example:

```bash
docker run node
```

What happens:

* Docker checks for the image **locally**
* If not found → Docker **pulls** it from Docker Hub automatically
* Then Docker creates a **container** *based on that image*

---

## 🔹 Important Behavior: Container Isolation

Running `docker run node`:

* Creates a container
* Runs Node.js **inside** that container
* But: The interactive shell *is not exposed to you* by default
  → so nothing “visible” happens

Even though it ran, you don’t see the Node REPL.

---

## 🔹 Verifying Containers

See all containers (running or exited):

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Output shows:

* Container ID
* Image used
* Creation time
* Status (e.g., **Exited**)
* Auto-generated name

This confirms containers were created even if you saw nothing happen.

---

## 🔹 Running a Container with Interactive Access

To open an interactive session **inside** the container:

```bash
docker run -it node
```

Meaning of flags:

* `-i` → interactive (keeps STDIN open)
* `-t` → pseudo-terminal
  Together: **interactive terminal access**

Inside the container, you now have the Node REPL:

```bash
> 1 + 1
2
```

---

## 🔹 Proof of Container Isolation

The Node version inside the container might differ from your system:

Inside container:

```
node -v  → 14.9.x
```

On your system:

```
node -v  → 14.7.x
```

This proves:

* The container runs **its own isolated environment**
* You **don’t need Node installed** on your machine to run a Node container

---

## 🔹 Exiting the Container

Exit interactive mode:

* Press **Ctrl + C twice**
* Or type:

  ```bash
  .exit
  ```

Once you exit:

* The container stops
* It still shows up in `docker ps -a` as **Exited**

---

## 🔹 Multiple Containers From the Same Image

You can create and run multiple containers from the **same** image:

```bash
docker run -it node
docker run -it node
```

Each one:

* Is a separate instance
* Runs independently
* Shares the same underlying image

---

## 🔹 Key Takeaways

* **Images** = packaged code + environment
* **Containers** = running processes created from images
* `docker run` = Pull image (if needed) + create & run a container
* Use `-it` to interact with the container’s shell
* Containers run in **isolation**, with their own tools & versions
* You can run multiple containers based on the same image
