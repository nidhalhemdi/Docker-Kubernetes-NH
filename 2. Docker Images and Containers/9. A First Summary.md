## **“A First Summary”**

 Reviewing the key ideas learned so far about **Docker images** and **containers**:

## **1. Images Contain Your App + Environment**

* A Docker image is a blueprint that bundles:

  * Your application code
  * The required environment and tools (e.g., Node.js)
  * All setup steps defined in the Dockerfile
* The Dockerfile controls everything that goes into the image.

## **2. Containers Are Running Instances of Images**

* Containers are created **from images**.
* A container is your **running application**.
* You can run multiple containers from the same image.

## **3. Containers Don’t Copy the Image Internally**

* A container **does NOT duplicate your code** or environment.
* It **reuses the layers in the image** and then adds one *runtime layer* (e.g., the running Node server).
* This keeps Docker efficient.

## **4. Images = Template | Containers = Active Instances**

* The image serves as the immutable blueprint.
* A container:

  * adds runtime state,
  * runs in isolation,
  * gets its own resources (memory, CPU slices),
  * but still relies on the image beneath it.

## **5. Big Picture**

Docker’s main idea is to provide isolated, consistent environments that contain:

* your app,
* its code,
* all dependencies and tools.

Containers derived from the same image share the same environment but run independently.
