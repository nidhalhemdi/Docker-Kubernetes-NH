# **Module Introduction**

---

## **🎯 Purpose of This Module**

To understand the **two most fundamental Docker concepts**:

1. **Images**
2. **Containers**

These are the **building blocks** of everything you do with Docker.

---

## **🧩 Key Concepts Explained Simply**

### **1. What is a Docker Image?**

* A **template / blueprint** for creating containers.
* Contains:

  * OS layer(s)
  * Application code
  * Dependencies
* You **don’t run an image directly** — you run a container *from* an image.

### **2. What is a Docker Container?**

* A **running instance** of an image.
* Basically:
  **Image = recipe**
  **Container = the meal created from that recipe**
* Containers are isolated but lightweight.

### **3. Relationship Between Images and Containers**

* You **must have an image** to create a container.
* A single image can create many containers.
* Containers depend on images for:

  * How they run
  * What is installed
  * How software behaves

---

## **📦 What You Will See in This Module**

### **Images**

* Using **pre-built images** from Docker Hub.
* Creating **your own custom images**.
* Understanding layers and builds.

### **Containers**

* How to **run**, **stop**, **remove**, and **manage** them.
* How to configure container behavior.
* How containers are built *from* images.

---

## **🛠️ Practical Skills (Commands we'll Use Later)**

* Pull an image:

  ```bash
  docker pull <image-name>
  ```
* Run a container:

  ```bash
  docker run <image-name>
  ```
* List containers:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  docker ps -a
  ```
* Stop a container:

  ```bash
  docker stop <container>
  ```
* Remove a container:

  ```bash
  docker rm <container>
  ```
* Build your own image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t <name> .
  ```

## **💡 Summary**

These concepts are the foundation of Docker.
we’ll learn:

* What images and containers *really* are,
* How they depend on each other,
* How to use pre-built images,
* How to build your own,
* How to run and manage containers confidently.
