# **Docker Images & Containers — What and Why?**

## 🔹 **Core Definitions**

### **Container**

* A **running instance** of your application.
* Contains:

  * Your code (e.g., Node.js app)
  * The runtime environment & needed tools
* It is the **execution unit** — *the thing that actually runs*.

### **Image**

* A **template / blueprint** used to create containers.
* Contains:

  * Your application code
  * All configuration + environment setup instructions
* It is **NOT running** — it is a static packaged recipe.

## 🔹 **Why Both?**

### **Separation of Image & Container**

* You **build the image once**, including:

  * Code
  * Dependencies
  * Environment setup
* You can then **run many containers** from that same image.

  * Example: Spin up 5 instances of your Node.js server across different machines.

### **Think of it like:**

* **Image = Class**
* **Container = Object created from that class**

This design:

* Makes distribution easy (share the image)
* Makes scaling easy (run multiple containers)
* Ensures consistency (every container is identical because it uses the same image)

---

## 🔹 **Practical Understanding**

* **Images = packaged instructions + code**
* **Containers = live running applications created from images**

Docker workflow always looks like:

1. **Create (or download) an image**
2. **Run containers from that image**
3. Optional: run multiple containers using the same image

This is the **fundamental concept** of Docker.
