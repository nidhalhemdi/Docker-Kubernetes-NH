# **Entering Interactive Mode**

Explaining how to run containers **interactively** so you can **provide input** (stdin) to applications that require user interaction, such as a Python script asking for numbers.

---

# 🔧 **Key Concepts**

## **1. Containers don’t accept input by default**

* `docker run` attaches you to a container’s **output**, but **not input**.
* Many terminal-based programs **need user input** — a plain `docker run` will cause them to crash or instantly exit.

---

# 🧱 **2. Dockerfile to run a Python script**

Typical Dockerfile for a simple Python CLI program:

```
FROM python
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "rng.py"]
```

Then build:

```
docker build -t rng-app .
```

---

# 🏃 **3. Why the first docker run fails**

If you run:

```
docker run rng-app
```

You **can see error output**, but *you cannot type anything* → the script expects user input but Docker is not forwarding stdin.

---

# 🎛️ **4. Interactive Mode: -i and -t**

To let the container **receive input**, use:

### `-i` = keep STDIN open

### `-t` = allocate a terminal (TTY)

Combined:

```
docker run -it rng-app
```

Now you can type inside the container app:

```
Enter min: 1
Enter max: 10
Random number: 7
```

After finishing, the container stops automatically (normal for CLI apps).

---

# 🔄 **5. Restarting an interactive container**

If you restart the container:

```
docker start CONTAINER
```

It runs in **detached mode** by default → you **cannot input anything**.

### To restart *and* attach:

```
docker start -a -i CONTAINER
```

* `-a` → attach to output
* `-i` → allow input

(You don’t need `-t` again — the original tty is remembered.)

---

# 🪟 **6. When to use interactive mode**

Use `-it` when your container:

* Is **not a server**
* Requires **user input**
  (CLI tools, scripts, REPLs)
* Should behave like a traditional **terminal app**

Docker is not only for long-running servers — it can run small command-line tools too.

| Purpose                           | Command                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Build image                       | `docker build -t rng-app .`      |
| Run with input + terminal         | `docker run -it rng-app`         |
| Start interactive container again | `docker start -a -i <container>` |
| See options                       | `docker run --help`              |
